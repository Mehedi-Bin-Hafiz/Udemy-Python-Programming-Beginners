# OOP is a concept of object and class
# there are three widely used programming style procedural, functional, and OOP
# python support all these style
# once we create class we can create object of this class and keep it into a variable. it is known as instance


# the init method also known as magic or special method. when a function created starting with double __ then it called special method.
# special method inside class is called firstly and automatically when the class is called

# self.variable is known as instance variable. if we access instance variable within the class then we use self.variable

# we can access instance attributes by the name of the instance of this class and within the class we use self parameter


# class attributes and instance attributes .
# basically we declare instance attribute inside the init method
# basically we declare class attribute after declaration of class
# instance attribute are different based on instances. but class attribute are same for all
''' if we want to change class attribute then we can do it by this syntax classname.attributename=value'''
