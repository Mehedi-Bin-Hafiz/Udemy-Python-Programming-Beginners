# OOP is a concept of object and class
# there are three widely used programming style procedural, functional, and OOP
# python support all these style
# once we create class we can create object of this class and keep it into a variable. it is known as instance


# the init method also known as magic or special method. when a function created starting with double __ then it called special method.
# special method inside class is called firstly and automatically when the class is called

# self.variable is known as instance variable. if we access instance variable within the class then we use self.variable
