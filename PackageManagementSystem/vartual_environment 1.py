# different application may be needed different version of package. one version can not be supported by another version. in order to maintain version we can use virtual environment.
# virtual environment can isolate one application environment from another.

# what is vm?
# vm allow packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally.
# the venv module provides support for creating virtual environments.
# each virtual environment has its own python binary and can have its own independent set of installed python packages in its site directories.
